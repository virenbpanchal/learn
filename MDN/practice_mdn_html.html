<b>Q) What is HTML?</b>
<br>
HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
<br>
Not a programming language.
<br>
It's a <i>markup language</i>.
<br>
It is used to "tell the browser how to structure the web pages you visit"
<br>
<b>Note :-</b> <b>Tags</b> in HTML are <b>case-insensitive</b> i.e they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a &lt;title&gt; tag could be written as &lt;title&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;TitLE&gt;, etc. and it will work fine. Best practice, however, is to write all tags in lowercase for consistency, readability and other reasons.
<br><br>
Example - <p>&lt;p&gt;This is an example sentence.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
Here,
<br>
1) Opening tag - &lt;p&gt; - it consists name of the element i.e. p here.
<br>
2) Closing tag - &lt;/p&gt; - same as a opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name.
<br>
3) The content - This is the content of the element, which is in this case just text.
<br>
4) The element - The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.
<br>

Nesting elements :- Put elements inside other elements. - this is called nesting.
Example - <p>This is an &lt;strong&gt;<strong>example</strong>&lt;/strong&gt; sentence.</p>
